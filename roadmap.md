## Roadmap

### Editors

Several editors are being developed to simplify working with OpenGIX including a [VS Code Extension]() that provides an interactive user interface and developer tools for increased developer productivity, and a containerized Angular application providing portability in real world deployments.

### Implementations

Currently `Layers` can be combined and exported to GeoJSOn and TopoJSON format for use in applications.
Common use cases:

- geographical maps & graphs

`npm opengix/app`

> GIXL fileformat
